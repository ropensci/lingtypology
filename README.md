`lingtypology` package connects R with the [Glottolog database (v. 4.4)](https://glottolog.org/) and provides additional functionality for linguistic mapping. The Glottolog database contains the catalogue of the world's languages. This package helps researchers to make linguistic maps, using philosophy of [the Cross-Linguistic Linked Data project](https://clld.org/), which uniform access to the data across publications. This package is based on [`leaflet` package](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), so `lingtypology` package is a package for linguistic interactive mapping.
